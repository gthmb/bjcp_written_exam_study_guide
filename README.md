# BJCP Written Study Guide

This site is meant to help those studying for the BJCP Written exam. A labor of love for my fellow judges trying to rank up!

In each section of the site, there are tables of data with empty cells. These cells can be clicked on to reveal the 'answer'. They can be clicked again to turn them red to indicate you answered incorrectly, clicked a second time to maintain the error state but hide the answer, and clicked again to show the initial empty state. It is meant to be used like flash-cards.

There is a select control to choose one of the possible recipes you will be asked to provide on the exam. These recipes are my own. You can reveal the description of the style and the target parameters. Also, the grist, hop bill, water and yeast. Calculation sections can be expanded to see how the values were arrived at.
